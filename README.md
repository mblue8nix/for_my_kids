Math-checker is a simple program to check my kids math without giving them the answer
before they get it corrrect. If they fail to answer the correct answer three times the program
will quit and tell them to get help from adult.

Example Usage:

```
sh-3.2$ python3 math-checker.py
Type in the math operation
 ie. +, * , /, -: *
Type the first number: 3
Type the second number: 3
What was your answer: 6
3 * 3

Your answer is wrong, try again...

Enter your new answer: 9

 The answer is: 9
Great Job, you got it!
```
